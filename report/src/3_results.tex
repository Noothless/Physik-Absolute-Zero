\section{Results}\label{sec_results}

    % Results
    % This paragraph is where you present the results from your
    % experiment. This could be in the form of a table (if only very few
    % parameters where measured) or as a figure. In the text you should
    % essentially describe what can be seen in the figures, i.e. explain
    % your axis and how the dependent variable changes as a function of
    % the independent variable. Discuss trends of the data as well as the
    % magnitude, origin and nature of the experimental uncertainties. Keep
    % in mind that the measurement results are always correct! They might
    % just not be the answer to the question you had in mind.

    % Depending on the experiment the discussion of the results can
    % also be a part of the data analysis section.



    % Data Analysis
    % In the data analysis section you describe the post processing of the
    % data. How did you obtain the data that you plot in the figures? The raw data does not necessarily need
    % to be presented in the report. An important part of this paragraph
    % are the measurement uncertainties. You should provide the
    % uncertainties of all experimental results, i.e. in the form of error
    % bars. Further, you should explain the origin of these uncertainties.

    % All figures or tables that are part of your report have to be
    % referenced somewhere in the text, ideally in order of their
    % appearance (``as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}''). Figures have to
    % have axis labels with units and a sensible scale. If more than on
    % data set is plotted you need to provide a legend. This may be a sentence in the caption (``red dots denote data measured with \SI{1}{\milli\volt}, blue crosses were measured with \SI{10}{\milli\volt}''). Make sure to use a consistent style for all referencing and citing. The best method is to use reference commands like those shown here, which also provide clickable links.

    % After you have presented the data you need to interpret it. To this
    % end you want to discuss the theoretical model that describes your
    % data and you will derive model parameters from your measurement data
    % (i.e. by fitting it to the data). There are many way how you can include equations and mathematical terms in your report. The easiest is to write them inside the text like this: $\Gamma =\SI{1.5}{\micro\meter\per\square\second}$. If you need to write a long equation, it is recommended to use e.g. the align environment.
    %     \begin{align}\label{eq:Gamma}
    %         \Gamma = \frac{a}{4\kappa}\times ...
    %     \end{align}
    % Such an equation can be referenced as Eq.~\eqref{eq:Gamma}. Here, you will again elaborate on
    % the confidence interval of the derived values (error propagation).
    % This is an important part of the report and it will be the basis for
    % the next paragraph.
